# Client Assertions (Mockup)

I often get frustrated that I don't have enough energy in the day to pursue things I think should exist. I think "that could be cool!" and then proceed to forget about it

For that reason I figured - hey, why not sometimes mockup ideas and show them to other folks who might have that energy/desire?

Anywho - this is an analytics tool based on your failure, insecurities and fears (as a team)!

The failures to predict your users' behavior. The failures to predict all the many states your users might find themselves in. Specifically monitoring and alerting your "sad paths" - _especially_ the ones you never expect users to hit

Why specifically track failures? It helps to think about all the things you could improve, errors you can prevent. It allows you to be immediately aware of the misconceptions you have about how your users use your product and how business/product changes affect it over time

On the computing side, "number going up is bad" is a very useful thing to know. Rather than "generic numbers" of raw analytics. You can more easily build a focused UX around it!
